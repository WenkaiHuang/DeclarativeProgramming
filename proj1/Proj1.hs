 -- Purpose: Perform a Musician game between composer and performer.

 -- In this logical guessing game, the performer guess 
 -- a three-pitch musical chord which select by the composer before. 
 -- The each pitch consists of a musical note from one of 
 -- A, B, C, D, E, F and G and an octave from 1, 2, 3. We need to 
 -- write some functions like toPitch, feed back, GameState, 
 -- ititialGuess, nextGuess and others to realize these guessing game. 
 -- The codes are shown in the below.
module Proj1 (Pitch, toPitch, feedback, GameState, initialGuess, nextGuess) where

import Data.List

 -- Define a data type which type constructor is Note and data constructor 
 --is either A, B, C, D, E, F, G to denote the Note.
data Note = A|B|C|D|E|F|G

 -- The type of Octave is Int.
type Octave = Int

 -- The Pitch data type consists of two arguments which are Note and Octave.
data Pitch = Pitch (Note, Octave)

 -- This function transfer the data type Pitch to the String
